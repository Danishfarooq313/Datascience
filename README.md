# Steps to run this project
Section 1: Imports and Setup
In this section, we start by importing necessary Python libraries and setting up the environment for our project. Here's what's happening:

We begin by importing libraries like PyTorch, torchvision, and other Python packages.
We use Google Colab to mount our Google Drive, which contains our dataset and saved models. This makes data access more convenient.
Section 2: Data Preparation
This section is all about organizing our dataset for training and testing:

We define class names for our dataset: 'normal', 'viral', and 'covid'.
We reorganize our dataset by moving images into specific directories for training and testing.
For testing, we select a subset of 30 images per class to evaluate our model's performance.
Section 3: Custom Dataset Class
We create a custom dataset class to handle our data:

The ChestXRayDataset class is based on PyTorch's torch.utils.data.Dataset.
This class loads and preprocesses image data. It includes tasks like resizing images, applying random horizontal flips for data augmentation, and converting images to tensors for model input.
The data is normalized to match the mean and standard deviation of the ImageNet dataset, which is used by the pre-trained ResNet model.
The dataset class is flexible and supports both training and testing datasets.
Section 4: Data Loading
We set up data loaders for our training and testing datasets:

We specify batch sizes for our data loaders to control how many images the model processes at once.
Section 5: Model Architecture
In this part, we define our model's architecture and related settings:

We load a pre-trained ResNet-18 model from torchvision. This model is known for its effectiveness in image classification tasks.
We modify the model's final fully connected layer to adapt it to our three classes (normal, viral, covid).
We select a loss function (Cross-Entropy) suitable for classification tasks and choose the Adam optimizer for training the model.
Section 6: Training Loop
This is the core of our project, where we train the model:

We create a training loop that runs for a specified number of epochs. An epoch is one complete pass through the training dataset.
In each training step, we perform forward and backward passes to update the model's parameters.
We monitor and calculate training and validation losses.
The training loop also calculates accuracy and evaluates the model's performance at regular intervals.
The training stops if the accuracy exceeds a specified threshold, ensuring that the model performs well.
Section 7: Model Saving and Loading
We handle saving and loading our trained model:

After training, we save the model to a file on Google Drive for later use.
This ensures that we can easily access our trained model without retraining it from scratch.
Section 8: Inference and Prediction
In the final part, we demonstrate how to use our trained model to make predictions on new images:

We load the saved model and set it to evaluation mode.
We define a function that takes an image as input, preprocesses it, and uses the model to make predictions.
Users can input an image path, and the model predicts whether the image shows a normal X-ray, viral pneumonia, or COVID-19 case.
This code represents a complete pipeline for training a deep learning model to detect viruses in chest X-ray images. You can use this explanation as a guide for creating a README on your GitHub repository, providing an overview of your project and its implementation details. Be sure to include additional information such as the dataset source and usage instructions for potential users of your code.
